# Corteza Corredor

Corredor is an automation script runner.
It loads and processes scripts it has access and offers them to Corteza backend server on request.

It starts a gRPC server with 2 simple services:
 - Server scripts with list and exec procedures
 - Client scripts with list and bundle procedures

See https://github.com/cortezaproejct/corteza-protobuf[protobuf service definition] for details.

Corredor loads and monitors user scripts in the configured location

## Server scripts

These scripts are executed by Corredor directly or indirectly by the Corteza backend server.
Scripts are not jailed or virtualized and run in the same context as the main Corredor app.
This will probably be changed in the future to prevent scripts doing actions such as stopping the whole Corredor server

Make sure your scripts are audited and making changes where they should.
Last line of defense is (Docker) container, where the Corredor application is running.

## Client scripts (WIP)

Client scripts are bundled with all their dependencies and 'Corteza webapp boot loader' with Webpack.

This bundles (each Corteza frontend app has one bundle) is loaded alongside the Corteza web application by the user's browser.

Boot loader makes sure that all client scripts are properly registered in the event bus and executed in right order and in the right context

Make sure your scripts are audited and properly coded.

## Development & testing

Corredor uses YARN for package management.
If you insist on using npm, make sure correct package versions are installed (yarn uses `yarn.lock` to keep track of exact versions used).

 1. `yarn` to install dependencies
 2. `yarn serve:dev` to start the development server (restarts when files change)
 3. `yarn test:unit` to run all unit tests (add `--watch` watch files for changes and restart)

.Note on Corredor's `package.json`
You'll see majority of development dependencies under dependencies key.
This is intentional as we want to access certain packages in non-dev mode as well (bundling client scripts with webpack, Typescript compiling, running unit tests)

### Environmental variables

Corredor read `.env` file if exists and merges that with environmental variables.
See https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv[dotenv] package for details.

All possible configuration is covered in `src/config.ts` where all environmental variables are read and processed.

### BloomRPC

RPC server can be manually tested with any gRPC client.
If you do not have your favorite, we recommend https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc[BloomRPC].

Testing with BloomRPC client & secure server:

 1. Click on TSL button on top
 2. Add root certificate (ca.crt)
 3. Private Key (private.key)
 4. Cert Chain (public.crt)


## Development plan (unordered)

 - Bundling and serving Vue.js components
 - Bundling and serving SCSS and binary content
 - Updating files via gRPC service
 - Support for remote (git repository) location for user scripts
 - Support for basic git operations
 - Automatically running user script unit tests before loading scripts
 - Support TypeScript for user scripts
